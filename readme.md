# Tramway SDK Template Project

The Tramway SDK framework is constructed as a C++ library, so in order to use it
you need an application to embed it in. This is such an application and a very
minimalistic application at that.

After downloading the repository you can either use it as a base for your C++
project, or you can use it for doing Lua scripting, since it contains pre-built
binaries.

This repository also contains binaries for all of the other Tramway SDK
utilities.
